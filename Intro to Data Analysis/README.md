# Intro to Data Analysis

## About this Course
This course will introduce you to the world of data analysis. You'll learn how
to go through the entire data analysis process, which includes:

* Posing a question
* Wrangling your data into a format you can use and fixing any problems with it
* Exploring the data, finding patterns in it, and building your intuition about
it
* Drawing conclusions and/or making predictions
* Communicating your findings

You'll also learn how to use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
to write code that's cleaner, more concise, and runs faster.

This course is part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree.

## What You Will Learn
Lesson 1: Data Analysis Process
- Learn about the data analysis process.
- Pose a question, wrangle your data, draw conclusions and/or make predictions.
- Complete an analysis of Udacity student data using pure Python, with few
additional libraries.

Lesson 2: NumPy and Pandas for 1D Data
- Start learning to use NumPy and Pandas to make the data analysis process
easier.
- Features that apply to one-dimensional data.
- Learn to use NumPy arrays, Pandas Series, and vectorized operations.

Lesson 3: NumPy and Pandas for 2D Data
- Continue learning about NumPy and Pandas, this time focusing on
two-dimensional data.
- Learn to use two-dimensional NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames.
- Group your data and to combine data from multiple files.

Lesson 4: Investigate a Dataset
- Use NumPy and Pandas to go through the data analysis process on one of a list
of recommended datasets.

## Prerequisites and Requirements
To take this course, you need to be comfortable programming in Python.

* You should be familiar with if statements, loops, functions, lists, sets, and
dictionaries. To learn about any of these topics, take the course Intro to
Computer Science.
* You should also be familiar with classes, objects, and modules. To learn about
these topics, take the course Programming Foundations with Python.

## Why Take This Course
This course is a good first step towards understanding the data analysis process
as a whole. Before delving into each individual phase, it is important to learn
the difference between all phases of the process and how they relate to each
other. After taking this course, you will be better positioned to succeed in
other courses in the Data Analyst Nanodegree program. For example, a student who
started with Data Analysis with R, which covers the exploratory data analysis
phase, might not understand at that point the difference between data
exploration and data wrangling. By taking this course first, you will learn what
each phase accomplishes and how it fits into the larger process.

This course also covers the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib,
which are indispensable tools for doing data analysis in Python. Their many
convenient functions and high performance make writing data analysis code a lot
easier!
