# Intro to Inferential Statistics

## About this Course
Statistics is an important field of math that is used to analyze, interpret, and
 predict outcomes from data. Descriptive statistics will teach you the basic
 concepts used to describe data. This is a great beginner course for those
 interested in Data Science, Economics, Psychology, Machine Learning, Sports
 analytics and just about any other field.

Inferential statistics allows us to draw conclusions from data that might not be
immediately obvious. This course focuses on enhancing your ability to develop
hypotheses and use common tests such as t-tests to validate your claims.

## What You Will Learn
Lesson 1: Intro to Research Methods
- Introduction to several statistical study methods.
- Learn the positives and negatives of each.

Lesson 2: Visualizing Data
- Take your data and display it to the world.
- Create and interpret histograms, bar charts, and frequency plots.

Lesson 3: Central Tendency
- Compute and interpret the 3 measures of center for distributions: the mean,
median, and mode.

Lesson 4: Variability
- Quantify the spread of data using the range and standard deviation.
- Identify outliers in data sets using the concept of the interquartile range.

Lesson 5: Standardizing
- Convert distributions into the standard normal distribution using the Z-score.
- Compute proportions using standardized distributions.

Lesson 6: Normal Distribution
- Use normalized distributions to compute probabilities
- Use the Z-table to look up the proportions of observations above, below, or in
between values

Lesson 7: Sampling Distributions
- Apply the concepts of probability and normalization to sample data sets.

Lesson 8: Estimation
- Estimate population parameters from sample statistics using confidence
intervals.
- Estimate the effect of a treatment.

Lesson 9: Hypothesis Testing
- How to determine if a treatment has changed the value of a population
parameter.

Lesson 10: t-tests
- How to test the effect of a treatment.
- Compare the difference in means for two groups when there are small sample
sizes.
