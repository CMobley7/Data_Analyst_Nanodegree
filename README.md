# Data Analyst Nanodegree

## About this Nanodegree
We built this program with expert analysts and scientists at leading technology
companies to ensure you master the exact skills necessary to build a career in
data science.

Learn to organize data, uncover patterns and insights, make predictions using
machine learning, and clearly communicate critical findings.

## Nanodegree Program Syllabus
**Project 1: 7 Day Warm-Up: Find the Optimal Chopstick Length**

An opportunity to get started with data analysis and receive some quick feedback
about your progress.

Set up iPython notebook and commonly used data analysis libraries on your own
computer. Use them to dig into the results of an experiment testing the optimal
length of chopsticks and present your findings.

**Project 2: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon**

Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect,
a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition
for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the
results.

**Project 3: Investigate a Dataset**

Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and
Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a
question and finishing by sharing your findings.

**Project 4: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data**

Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data
munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity,
accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap
data for a part of the world that you care about.

**Project 5: Explore and Summarize Data**

Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in
one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for
distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

**Project 6: Identify Fraud from Enron Email**

Play detective and put your machine learning skills to use by building an
algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on
the public Enron financial and email dataset.

**Project 7: Make Effective Data Visualization**

Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights
trends or patterns in the data. Use either dimple.js or d3.js to create the
visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice
of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and
effective communication.

**Project 8: Design an A/B Test**

Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and
how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was
run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.
