# Intro to Machine Learning

## About this Course
Machine Learning is a first-class ticket to the most exciting careers in data
analysis today. As data sources proliferate along with the computing power to
process them, going straight to the data is one of the most straightforward ways
to quickly gain insights and make predictions.

Machine learning brings together computer science and statistics to harness that
predictive power. It’s a must-have skill for all aspiring data analysts and data
scientists, or anyone else who wants to wrestle all that raw data into refined
trends and predictions.

This is a class that will teach you the end-to-end process of investigating data
through a machine learning lens. It will teach you how to extract and identify
useful features that best represent your data, a few of the most important
machine learning algorithms, and how to evaluate the performance of your machine
learning algorithms.

This course is also a part of our Data Analyst Nanodegree.

## What You Will Learn
Lesson 1: Welcome to Machine Learning
- Learn what Machine Learning is and meet Sebastian Thrun!
- Find out where Machine Learning is applied in Technology and Science.

Lesson 2: Naive Bayes
- Use Naive Bayes with scikit learn in python.
- Splitting data between training sets and testing sets with scikit learn.
- Calculate the posterior probability and the prior probability of simple
distributions.

Lesson 3: Support Vector Machines
- Learn the simple intuition behind Support Vector Machines.
- Implement an SVM classifier in SKLearn/scikit-learn.
- Identify how to choose the right kernel for your SVM and learn about RBF and
Linear Kernels.

Lesson 4: Decision Trees
- Code your own decision tree in python.
- Learn the formulas for entropy and information gain and how to calculate them.
- Implement a mini project where you identify the authors in a body of emails
using a decision tree in Python.

Lesson 5: Choose your own Algorithm
- Decide how to pick the right Machine Learning Algorithm among K-Means,
Adaboost, and Decision Trees.

Lesson 6: Datasets and Questions
- Apply your Machine Learning knowledge by looking for patterns in the Enron
Email Dataset.
- You'll be investigating one of the biggest frauds in American history!

Lesson 7: Regressions
- Understand how continuous supervised learning is different from discrete
learning.
- Code a Linear Regression in Python with scikit-learn.
- Understand different error metrics such as SSE, and R Squared in the context
of Linear Regressions.

Lesson 8: Outliers
- Remove outliers to improve the quality of your linear regression predictions.
- Apply your learning in a mini project where you remove the residuals on a real
dataset and reimplement your regressor.
- Apply your same understanding of outliers and residuals on the Enron Email
Corpus.

Lesson 9: Clustering
- Identify the difference between Unsupervised Learning and Supervised Learning.
- Implement K-Means in Python and Scikit Learn to find the center of clusters.
- Apply your knowledge on the Enron Finance Data to find clusters in a real
dataset.

Lesson 10: Feature Scaling
- Understand how to preprocess data with feature scaling to improve your
algorithms.
- Use a min mx scaler in sklearn.

## Prerequisites and Requirements
To succeed in this course, you must be proficient at programming in Python and
basic statistics. If you need a refresher on any of these topics, you can check
out these courses:

* Intro to Computer Science (You should know basic data structures and control
  statements, and be able to write and import functions.)
* Inferential Statistics
* Descriptive Statistics

One additional course that would be nice to have is Intro to Data Science, as
this will get you familiar with scientific problem-solving. However, completion
of that class isn't required for success. We will also use a tiny bit of git,
which you can also learn about on Udacity.

One thing that we don’t require is previous exposure to machine learning. If
you’re a machine learning beginner, you’re in the right place.

## Why Take This Course
In this course, you’ll learn by doing! We’ll bring machine learning to life by
showing you fascinating use cases and tackling interesting real-world problems
like self-driving cars. For your final project you’ll mine the email inboxes
and financial data of Enron to identify persons of interest in one of the
greatest corporate fraud cases in American history.

When you finish this introductory course, you’ll be able to analyze data using
machine learning techniques, and you’ll also be prepared to take our Data
Analyst Nanodegree. We’ll get you started on your machine learning journey by
teaching you how to use helpful tools, such as pre-written algorithms and
libraries, to answer interesting questions.
