# Data Visualization and D3.js

## About this Course
Learn the fundamentals of data visualization and practice communicating with
data. This course covers how to apply design principles, human perception, color
theory, and effective storytelling to data visualization. If you present data to
others, aspire to be an analyst or data scientist, or if you’d like to become
more technical with visualization tools, then you can grow your skills with this
course.

The course does not cover exploratory approaches to discover insights about
data. Instead, the course focuses on how to visually encode and present data to
an audience once an insight has been found.

This course is part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree.

## What You Will Learn
Lesson 1: Visualization Fundamentals
- Learn about the elements of great data visualization.
- Meet data visualization experts, learn about data visualization in the context
of data science.
- Learn how to represent data values in visual form.

Lesson 2: Building Blocks
- Learn how to use the open standards of the web to create graphical elements.
- Select elements on the page, add SVG elements, and how to style SVG elements.
- Instructor Notes throughout this lesson are available if you have little or no
experience with HTML and CSS.

Lesson 3: Design Principles
- Which chart type to use for a data set.
- Colors to avoid when making graphics.
- How to determine if a graphic is effective.

Lesson 4: Dimple js
- Create graphics using the Dimple JavaScript library.
- Learn about this library as a gentle coding introduction before learning about
D3.js.
- Produce great graphics with minimal code and interactivity without any extra
effort.

Lesson 5: Narratives
- Learn how to incorporate different narrative structures into your
visualizations.
- Learn about bias in the data visualization process and learn how to add
context.

Lesson 6: Animation and Interaction
- Learn how to leverage animation and interaction to bring more data insights to
your audience.
- Learn how to create a bubble map for the World Cup data set.

## Prerequisites and Requirements
Regardless of your programming background, you can learn about data
visualization and design principles in Lesson 1a and Lesson 2a without the
following recommended background.

To succeed in this course, you should to be familiar with basic programming
principles, including data types (strings, arrays, booleans, etc.), if else
statements, and for loops. You should also be able to describe concepts like
functions and objects. Our Intro to Computer Science and Programming
Fundamentals with Python courses are great places to get started.

Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS (structuring and styling a web page) is not
required but highly recommended. We suggest taking the Intro to HTML and CSS
course if you have no experience with HTML or CSS.

This course is unique in that the final project can be completed using either
dimple.js or d3.js. The visualization library, dimple.js, is easier to use than
d3.js and requires less background knowledge. Furthermore, a graphic can be
created in considerably fewer lines of code using dimple.js as opposed to d3.js.

So why should you learn d3.js?

Data Driven Documents (d3.js) allows you to build highly customized graphics.
If you would like to gain more technical skills and learn more about Javascript
and open web standards, then you should complete Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 in order
to prepare for the final project.

If you would like to complete the final project using d3.js, you should have
some experience reading and using documentation. For example, you should be able
to code a for loop in Javascript or be able to look up the syntax to work with
strings and arrays in Javascript. We recommend taking the Javascript Basics
course if you have little to no experience with Javascript.

## Why Take This Course
Learn by doing! You will analyze existing data visualization and create new ones
to learn about the field. At it’s core, data visualization is a form of
communication. Learn how to be a great communicator and how to enable readers to
walk away from your graphics with insight and understanding. This course also
makes use of open web standards (HTML, CSS, and SVG) to create data
visualizations.

You can also learn how to...

communicate clearly with the best visual representation of your data
tell stories, spark discussion, and create calls to actions for readers
design graphics like ones from the NYTimes and other media companies
how to use open web technologies to create an online portfolio of your work
use visualization libraries (dimple.js and D3.js) to create graphics
