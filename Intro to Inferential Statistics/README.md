# Intro to Inferential Statistics

## About this Course
Inferential statistics allows us to draw conclusions from data that might not be
immediately obvious. This course focuses on enhancing your ability to develop
hypotheses and use common tests such as t-tests, ANOVA tests, and regression to
validate your claims.

## What You Will Learn
Lesson 1: Estimation
- Estimate population parameters from sample statistics using confidence
intervals.
- Estimate the effect of a treatment.

Lesson 2: Hypothesis Testing
- How to determine if a treatment has changed the value of a population
parameter.

Lesson 3: t-tests
- How to test the effect of a treatment.
- Compare the difference in means for two groups when there are small sample
sizes.

Lesson 4: ANOVA
- Learn how to test whether or not there are differences between three or more
groups.

Lesson 5: Correlation
- Learn how to describe and test the strength of a relationship between two
variables.

Lesson 6: Regression
- How changes in one variable are related to changes in a second variable.

## Prerequisites and Requirements

the following:

* calculating the mean and standard deviation of a data set
* central limit theorem
* interpreting probability and probability distributions
* normal distributions and sampling distributions
* normalizing observations
