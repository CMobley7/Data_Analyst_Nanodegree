# Data Wrangling with MongoDB

## About this Course
In this course, we will explore how to wrangle data from diverse sources and
shape it to enable data-driven applications. Some data scientists spend the bulk
 their time doing this!

Students will learn how to gather and extract data from widely used data
formats. They will learn how to assess the quality of data and explore best
practices for data cleaning. We will also introduce students to MongoDB,
covering the essentials of storing data and the MongoDB query language together
with exploratory analysis using the MongoDB aggregation framework.

This is a great course for those interested in entry-level data science
positions as well as current business/data analysts looking to add big data to
their repertoire, and managers working with data professionals or looking to
leverage big data.

This course is also a part of our Data Analyst Nanodegree.

## Prerequisites and Requirements
The ideal student should have the following skills:

* Programming experience in Python or a willingness to read a little
documentation to understand examples and exercises throughout the course.
* The ability to perform rudimentary system administration on Windows or Unix
* At least some experience using a unix shell or Windows PowerShell will be
helpful, but is not required.

No prior experience with databases is needed.

**About MongoDB**

This course is developed in conjunction with MongoDB, Inc., the originator and
primary contributor to the open source database MongoDB. MongoDB is the leading
NoSQL database. Designed for how we build and run applications today, MongoDB
empowers organizations to be more agile and scalable. It enables new types of
applications, better customer experience, faster time to market and lower costs.

## Why Take This Course
At the end of the class, students should be able to:

* Programmatically extract data stored in common formats such as csv, Microsoft
Excel, JSON, XML and scrape web sites to parse data from HTML.
* Audit data for quality (validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and
  uniformity) and critically assess options for cleaning data in different
  contexts.
* Store, retrieve, and analyze data using MongoDB.

This course concludes with a final project where students incorporate what they
have learned to address a real-world data analysis problem.
