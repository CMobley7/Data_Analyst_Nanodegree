# A/B Testing

## About this Course
This course will cover the design and analysis of A/B tests, also known as split
tests, which are online experiments used to test potential improvements to a
website or mobile application. Two versions of the website are shown to
different users - usually the existing website and a potential change. Then, the
results are analyzed to determine whether the change is an improvement worth
launching. This course will cover how to choose and characterize metrics to
evaluate your experiments, how to design an experiment with enough statistical
power, how to analyze the results and draw valid conclusions, and how to ensure
that the the participants of your experiments are adequately protected.

## What You Will Learn
Lesson 1: Overview of A/B Testing
- This lesson will cover what A/B testing is and what it can be used for.
- How to construct a binomial confidence interval for the results.
- How to decide whether the change is worth the launch cost.

Lesson 2: Policy and Ethics for Experiments
- How to make sure the participants of your experiments are adequately protected.
- What questions you should be asking regarding the ethicality of experiments.
- The four main ethics principles to consider when designing experiments.

Lesson 3: Choosing and Characterizing Metrics
- Learn techniques for brainstorming metrics.
- What to do when you can't measure directly.
- Characteristics to consider when validating metrics.

Lesson 4: Designing an Experiment
- How to choose which users will be in your experiment and control group.
- When to limit your experiment to a subset of your entire user base.
- Design decisions affect the size of your experiment.

Lesson 5: Analyzing Results
- How to analyze the results of your experiments.
- Run sanity checks to catch problems with the experiment set-up.
- Check conclusions with multiple methods, including a binomial sign test.

## Prerequisites and Requirements
This course requires introductory knowledge of descriptive and inferential
statistics. If you haven't learned these topics, or need a refresher, they are
covered in the Udacity courses Inferential Statistics and Descriptive
Statistics.

Prior experience with A/B testing is not required, and neither is programming
knowledge.

## Why Take This Course
A/B testing, or split testing, is used by companies like Google, Microsoft,
Amazon, Ebay/Paypal, Netflix, and numerous others to decide which changes are
worth launching. By using A/B tests to make decisions, you can base your
decisions on actual data, rather than relying on intuition or HiPPO's - the
highest paid person's opinion! Designing good A/B tests and drawing valid
conclusions can be difficult. You can almost never measure exactly what you want
to know (such as whether the users are "happier" on one version of the site),
so you need to find good proxies. You need sanity checks to make sure your
experimental set-up isn't flawed, and you need to use a variety of statistical
techniques to make sure the results you're seeing aren't due to chance. This
course will walk you through the entire process. At the end, you will be ready
to help businesses small or large make crucial decisions that could
significantly affect their future!
